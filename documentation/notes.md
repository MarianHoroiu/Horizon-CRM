Need to build a CRM for employee management.

We have administation zone where we administer roles and permisions (CASL - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission systems).
The employees can see their own profile.
We can upload documents (advanced documents managements systems). MinioS3 for documents storage.

TanStack, NextJS 15+, Shadcn, Tailwind, TypeScript, SQLLite with Prisma.
Authentification with Google, email/password (tokens, not session).

Standard functional design using Shadcn components.
API for authentication.
Action Components, Server Actions, Suspense, Optimistic.
Configure from BE the custom roles with permissions: admin, employee and manager.

Define NextJS standards, build a TechStack for each technology.
Build a Story Template and a Task Template.

Create an architectural document and keep it up to date.
