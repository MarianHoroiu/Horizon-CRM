## Server and Client Components

### Server Components Best Practices

- Use Server Components for data-fetching and operations that don't require client-side interactivity
- Keep heavy logic and data processing on the server to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement proper error boundaries with error.js files
- Use layout.js for shared UI elements across multiple pages

### Client Components Best Practices

- Mark components with 'use client' directive only when necessary
- Use Client Components for interactive UI elements that require state or browser APIs
- Keep Client Components lean by moving data fetching to parent Server Components
- Avoid unnecessarily nesting Client Components inside other Client Components

## App Router Architecture

### Project Organization

- Follow the app directory convention for organized routing
- Leverage nested folders to represent route segments
- Use special files like page.js, layout.js, and loading.js for specific functionality
- Implement route groups (folders with parentheses) to organize code without affecting the URL structure

### App Router Special Files

- Implement error.js for graceful error handling at the route segment level
- Use loading.js for automatic loading states during navigation and data fetching
- Create not-found.js for custom 404 pages
- Use layout.js for persistent UI elements across multiple pages

### Shared Layouts

- Create nested layouts for consistent UI across routes
- Use route groups to share layouts across specific sections
- Implement template.js when you need a new instance of the layout on navigation
- Separate route-specific concerns from shared layout logic

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### SSR Fundamentals

- Implement dynamic rendering for personalized content and user-specific data
- Use SSR for pages that require fresh data on each request
- Balance SSR with caching strategies to optimize performance
- Implement streaming SSR to improve Time To First Byte (TTFB)

### SSR vs. Static Generation

- Use static generation for content that doesn't change frequently
- Implement SSR for pages with frequently updated or user-specific content
- Consider hybrid approaches with selective hydration
- Use the appropriate route segment config options to control rendering mode

### SSR Performance Optimization

- Minimize dependencies in SSR components to reduce server load
- Implement proper caching headers for SSR responses
- Use streaming to improve perceived performance
- Consider using Edge Runtime for faster SSR response times

## Data Fetching Strategies

### Caching and Revalidation

- Define appropriate revalidation strategies using `revalidate`, `revalidatePath()`, and `revalidateTag()`
- Use fetch cache with appropriate TTLs for API requests
- Implement on-demand revalidation for frequently changing data
- Use tags to group related cache entries for targeted revalidation

### Parallel Data Fetching

- Use Promise.all() for fetching multiple data sources in parallel
- Implement dedicated Suspense boundaries for independent data fetches
- Prevent request waterfalls by fetching parent data before child components
- Consider data dependencies when structuring component hierarchy

## Routing Patterns

### File-Based Routing

- Maintain a clear page structure following the app directory conventions
- Use route groups (folders with parentheses) to organize routes without affecting URL structure
- Implement loading.js files for automatic loading states
- Design URL patterns considering SEO and user experience

### Dynamic Routes

- Use catch-all routes ([...slug]) sparingly and with well-defined patterns
- Implement generateStaticParams() for pre-rendering dynamic routes at build time
- Provide appropriate fallbacks for dynamic routes that aren't pre-rendered
- Design clear URL structures that communicate the resource hierarchy

## Suspense and Streaming

### Suspense Boundaries

- Place Suspense boundaries strategically around components that can load independently
- Create appropriate loading UI for different sections of your application
- Use nested Suspense boundaries for progressive loading of content
- Combine Suspense with Error Boundaries for robust error handling

### Streaming Optimization

- Enable streaming for improved Time To First Byte (TTFB)
- Prioritize critical UI elements to load first
- Stream responses for long-running operations
- Implement staggered loading for non-critical UI sections

## Partial Prerendering (PPR)

### PPR Implementation

- Enable PPR incrementally with the `experimental_ppr` route configuration
- Configure PPR in next.config.js with appropriate settings
- Identify static components that can be prerendered for immediate display
- Wrap dynamic content in Suspense boundaries for streaming

### PPR Best Practices

- Apply PPR to high-traffic pages for maximum performance benefit
- Enable PPR at the top-level segment to apply to nested routes
- Combine PPR with other optimizations like image optimization
- Test PPR implementations with varying network conditions

## Server Actions

### Action Implementation

- Keep Server Actions focused on specific tasks with clear inputs and outputs
- Implement proper error handling and validation in actions
- Use meaningful function names that describe the action's purpose
- Return appropriate response formats that client components can easily consume

### Form Handling with Server Actions

- Use the form action prop to directly connect forms with Server Actions
- Implement progressive enhancement for better user experience
- Leverage useFormStatus and useFormState hooks for client-side form state
- Use revalidatePath or revalidateTag after mutations to update cached data

### Optimistic Updates

- Implement optimistic updates with the useOptimistic hook
- Design consistent error handling patterns for failed actions
- Return structured responses from Server Actions for easier client handling
- Use pending states to provide visual feedback during action execution

### Separation of Concerns

- Organize actions by feature in dedicated directories
- Avoid UI logic in Server Actionsâ€”keep them focused on data operations
- Reuse actions across components when appropriate
- Implement proper error propagation to client components

## Type Validation with Zod

### Schema Definition

- Define Zod schemas for validating incoming data in Server Actions
- Create reusable schema definitions for common data structures
- Implement strict typing for better TypeScript integration
- Use schema composition for complex nested data structures

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas before processing
- Implement proper error messages for validation failures
- Use Zod's parsing capabilities to transform and sanitize data
- Leverage Zod's infer types for TypeScript integration

### Error Handling

- Return structured validation errors to the client
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Separate validation errors from business logic errors
- Provide clear user feedback for validation failures

### Form Data Validation

- Use Zod to validate form data in Server Actions
- Implement server-side validation with client-side feedback
- Create typed form schemas that can be shared between client and server
- Handle all edge cases in validation logic

## Middleware and Edge Runtime

### Middleware Patterns

- Use the matcher config to limit middleware execution to specific routes
- Implement lightweight logic to avoid performance bottlenecks
- Structure middleware for specific concerns (auth, logging, analytics)
- Consider using the Node.js runtime for complex middleware requirements (experimental)

### Edge Runtime Optimization

- Keep Edge Functions small and focused
- Implement geo-based routing for content localization
- Use Edge Functions for authentication, A/B testing, and request filtering
- Apply security headers consistently across your application

## Rendering Optimization

### Static and Dynamic Rendering

- Use static rendering for content that doesn't change frequently
- Implement dynamic rendering only for personalized or frequently changing content
- Consider hybrid approaches with static shells and dynamic islands
- Use the appropriate segment config options (dynamic, revalidate)

### Component Architecture

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Implement composition patterns for reusable UI
- Use proper component boundaries to optimize rendering
- Consider memory usage in component design

## Performance Best Practices

### Asset Optimization

- Use the Image component for automatic image optimization
- Implement font optimization with the next/font module
- Optimize third-party scripts with the Script component
- Analyze and reduce bundle sizes with the built-in bundle analyzer

### Lazy Loading

- Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- Use the React.lazy pattern for client components
- Apply code splitting for route-specific code
- Optimize third-party library imports

## Security Considerations

### Server Action Security

- Validate and sanitize all inputs in Server Actions
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use secure headers for all API responses
- Limit exposed information in error messages

### Authentication Patterns

- Implement proper auth middleware
- Use secure cookies and session management
- Consider Edge middleware for auth checks
- Apply proper authorization checks at the data access layer

## SEO Optimization

### Metadata Optimization

- Implement proper metadata using the Metadata API
- Create dynamic metadata based on page content
- Use Open Graph and Twitter card metadata
- Implement structured data for rich search results

### Rendering for SEO

- Ensure important content is server-rendered
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Create a comprehensive sitemap.xml
- Use canonical URLs for duplicate content

## Testing Strategies

### Component Testing

- Test Server Components and Client Components separately
- Mock fetch calls in Server Component tests
- Test both success and error paths
- Verify proper Suspense behavior

### End-to-End Testing

- Implement Playwright or Cypress for full application testing
- Test critical user flows
- Verify rendering optimizations work as expected
- Test across different devices and browsers

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration

- Use proper environment variables for different environments
- Implement secrets management following best practices
- Configure appropriate build settings for each environment
- Use CI/CD pipelines for consistent deployments

### Monitoring and Analytics

- Implement proper instrumentation with OpenTelemetry
- Set up error tracking and reporting
- Monitor performance metrics
