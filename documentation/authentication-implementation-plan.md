     - Credentials provider for email/password authentication
     - (Optional) OAuth providers for social login

2. **Secure Password Handling**

   - Implement password hashing using bcrypt (already in use in the project)
   - Set up password validation rules
   - Create secure account creation and login flows

3. **Session Management**
   - Configure JWT or database sessions based on requirements
   - Set appropriate session expiration times
   - Implement token refresh mechanism

### 2. Protected Routes

1. **Route Protection Strategy**

   - Create middleware for protected route access
   - Implement role-based access control using existing role field in User model
   - Set up redirect logic for unauthenticated users

2. **Dashboard Migration**
   - Move current landing page content to a protected dashboard route
   - Create a new public landing page focused on authentication
   - Implement smooth transitions between public and protected areas

### 3. User Interface

1. **Authentication Pages**

   - Design and implement login page
   - Create registration page (if needed)
   - Build password reset flow
   - Implement error handling and user feedback

2. **Navigation Components**

   - Develop a navigation component with conditional rendering
   - Create login/logout buttons that display based on authentication status
   - Implement user profile dropdown/menu for authenticated users

3. **User Experience Flows**

### Recommendation

Based on the project's current structure and requirements, NextAuth.js is the recommended solution due to:

1. The database schema is already structured for NextAuth.js
2. It provides a good balance of features, security, and ease of implementation
3. It's well-maintained and widely adopted in the Next.js ecosystem
4. It supports both credential and social authentication methods

However, if the project requires more customization or has specific requirements around user management, the alternatives should be considered with careful evaluation of the trade-offs.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Authentication Security

- **Secure Login Process**

  - Use generic error messages that don't reveal whether the username or password was incorrect
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - Use HTTPS for all authentication traffic

- **Strong Password Security**

  - Hash passwords using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
  - Enforce password complexity requirements
  - Prevent reuse of common/breached passwords

- **Session Protection**
  - Store tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies
  - Implement proper CSRF protection
  - Set appropriate token expiration times

### 2. Advanced Security Measures

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

  - Plan for future implementation of MFA
  - Identify integration points for MFA in the authentication flow

- **Data Isolation**

  - Keep sensitive authentication data separate from other application data
  - Implement proper access controls to authentication-related database tables

- **Regular Security Reviews**
  - Plan for periodic security audits
  - Keep authentication libraries updated
  - Monitor for new security vulnerabilities

## UI/UX Best Practices for Authentication

Creating an intuitive and secure authentication experience is crucial for user satisfaction and security. Here are best practices for designing the authentication UI:
