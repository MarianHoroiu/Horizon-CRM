I need to create a story for improving the "/dashboard/tasks" page.

You need to create a new folder within "/product-info/stories" folder. The folder name should match this pattern: `story-[number]-[story-name]`.
For example, if the story number is 1 and the story name is "Create a new task", the folder name should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`. The number should be the next number in the sequence of the existing stories.

Within the folder, you need to create a new file to match the folder name. For example, if the folder name is `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`, the file should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task].md`.

The markdown file needs to contain the following information:

- Story title
- Story description
- Story acceptance criteria
- Story tasks
- Story dependencies
- Story risks
- Story assumptions
