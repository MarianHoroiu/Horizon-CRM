# Task 01-04: Create Task Status Filter Functionality

## Parent Story

Story 01: Enhance Tasks Page

## Task Description

Implement filtering functionality that allows users to filter tasks by their status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled). The UI should update dynamically when filters are applied, and the selected filter state should be visually indicated to the user.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- `app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx` - Add filter component integration
- Create new component: `app/components/tasks/TaskStatusFilter.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/tasks/TaskList.tsx` - Update to handle filtered task display

### Required Components

- Filter button group showing all status options
- Active filter state indicator
- Integration with task list rendering

### API Endpoints Needed

- GET /api/tasks?status=[status] - Fetch tasks filtered by status

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can filter tasks by clicking on status filter buttons (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Active filter is visually indicated (highlighted button, different color, etc.)
- Task list updates immediately when a filter is applied
- An "All" filter option is available to show all tasks regardless of status
- If there are no results, the task list should display a message to the user (see similar implementation in the contacts page)
- Filter state is maintained if the user performs other actions like pagination
- Filter UI is responsive and works on mobile devices
- Task count should reflect the number of tasks in the filtered view

## Dependencies

- Existing Task model with status field
- Task list component that can receive and display filtered data

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
