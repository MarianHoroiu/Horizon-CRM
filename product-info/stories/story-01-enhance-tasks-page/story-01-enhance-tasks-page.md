# Story 01: Enhance Tasks Page

## Story Description

The current tasks page has limited functionality, only showing a static list of tasks. This story aims to enhance the tasks page by adding full CRUD operations, filtering by status, better organization, and improved user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can create new tasks with title, description, status, due date, and contact assignment
- Users can edit existing tasks to update any field
- Users can delete tasks with confirmation
- Tasks can be filtered by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Tasks should display their relationship to contacts and assigned users
- Task status can be changed directly from the tasks list view
- Tasks can be sorted by due date and creation date
- Pagination works correctly with all filters applied

## Story Tasks

1. Create a "New Task" modal form with all required fields
2. Implement task editing functionality
3. Add task deletion with confirmation
4. Create task status filter functionality that updates the UI
5. Enhance task card design to show contact and user information
6. Add quick status change buttons/dropdown on each task
7. Implement sorting options for the task list
8. Create proper pagination with filter state preservation

## Story Dependencies

- Existing Task model in the database schema
- Current tasks page layout
- Authentication system for user assignment

## Story Risks

- Changes to the task status might require synchronization with other parts of the application
- Filtering and pagination might impact performance with large datasets
- UX could become cluttered if too many filters/options are added

## Story Assumptions

- The current database schema for Tasks will remain largely unchanged
- Users have appropriate permissions to perform CRUD operations on tasks
- The UI framework (React with Tailwind CSS) will be used for all interface components
- Tasks are always associated with both a user and a contact
