## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can sort tasks by due date (ascending and descending)
- Users can sort tasks by creation date (ascending and descending)
- The current sort option is visually indicated to the user
- Sorting state persists when navigating away and returning to the page
- Sorting works correctly with existing filters applied
- Performance remains responsive even with large task lists
- Sort controls are accessible and work on mobile devices
