# Task 01-08: Create Proper Pagination with Filter State Preservation

## Parent Story

Story 01: Enhance Tasks Page

## Task Description

Implement a robust pagination system for the tasks list that maintains filter and sort states when navigating between pages. This will improve performance by limiting the number of tasks loaded at once while ensuring a seamless user experience when working with filtered views across multiple pages.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- `app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx` - Add pagination controls and state management
- `app/components/tasks/TaskList.tsx` - Update to handle pagination
- `app/components/common/Pagination.tsx` - Create or update pagination component
- `app/api/tasks/route.ts` - Ensure API supports pagination parameters

### Required Components

- Pagination controls (next/previous, page numbers)
- Page size selector
- Loading states for page transitions
- URL query parameter handling for state preservation

### API Endpoints Needed

- GET /api/tasks - Update to support pagination parameters (page, pageSize)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can navigate between pages of tasks
- Page size is configurable (e.g., 10, 25, 50 items per page)
- Current page and filter/sort selections are preserved in the URL
- Users can share URLs with specific filter/sort/page combinations
- Pagination works correctly with all filters and sorts applied
- Page transitions have appropriate loading states
- User is returned to the same page when navigating back to the tasks page
- Pagination is accessible and works on mobile devices

## Dependencies

- Filter functionality implementation
- Sorting implementation
- URL state management system

## Estimated Completion Time
