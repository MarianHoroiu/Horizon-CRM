## Implementation Approach

We'll use Next.js 15's App Router and the latest features like Server Components, Server Actions, and Suspense to create a highly responsive application:

2. **Server Actions**: Handle form submissions and data mutations with proper separation of concerns
3. **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access with PostgreSQL
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Create a responsive, consistent UI without excessive custom CSS

Each feature will be built incrementally, with regular feedback from users to ensure we're meeting their needs.

## Success Metrics

We'll measure the success of our CRM implementation using these practical metrics:
